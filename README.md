## Overview
This project aims to develop a skin cancer detection system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. The CNN model trained in this project can analyze images of skin lesions and classify them as either benign or malignant, aiding dermatologists in their diagnosis process.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of deep learning algorithm particularly effective for image classification tasks. CNNs are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, allowing them to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. This makes them highly suitable for tasks like object recognition in images.
